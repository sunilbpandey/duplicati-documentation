# Upgrading and downgrading

## Upgrading

The regular approach to upgrade Duplicati is to uninstall the previous version and then install the new one. Duplicati does not delete your configurations or backup databases during uninstall, so your settings and jobs will remain intact.

When Duplicati starts and discovers an older version of its configuration, it will automatically update the configuration and databases to the new version.

Installing new versions of Duplicati is part of the test process so any upgrade is intended to keep things working the same as before. In some cases the updates will start to give a warning on backups that were previously running without a warning. These warnings will describe what has changed and explain what to do to remove the warning.

Such warnings generally relate to a feature that will be removed or renamed but is not yet removed. The warnings give you a heads-up to avoid issues in the future and are generally simple to implement by editing a backup.

In rare cases a feature can no longer be supported, such as when a storage provider stops offering a service. For these, the feature will be removed and this will be mentioned in the release notes.

## Downgrading

Downgrades are usually not supported automatically because the old version was created before the current version; the code inside the old version cannot know what was changed. To avoid data loss, this process is controlled by version numbers inside the database. If you want to downgrade, you must use the [DatabaseTool](../../duplicati-programs/command-line-interface-cli-1/databasetool.md) manually **before** installing the older version.

Each update to the data will increment the version number of the database such that when an older version is running it will detect a higher number than it knows and stop there.

When a version upgrades the database, it will create a backup of the current database before upgrading. You can look for the database and backups in:

* `~/.config/Duplicati` on Linux
* `~/Library/Application Support/Duplicati` on MacOS
* `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Duplicati` on Windows.

If you have been using the new version you may have changes in the current database that would be lost by restoring the pre-upgrade database. In that case, you can [ask on the forum](https://forum.duplicati.com) for advice on how to downgrade.
