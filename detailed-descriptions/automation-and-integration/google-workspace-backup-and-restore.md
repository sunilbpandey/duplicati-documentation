# Google Workspace backup and restore

Duplicati supports backing up and restoring Google Workspace data through the Google APIs. The backup workflow captures content in native formats (for example, RFC 2822 for email and JSON for structured objects), and restore operations re-create items through the appropriate Google API endpoints.

{% hint style="info" %}
Google Workspace backup and restore was added in Stable 2.3
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Google Workspace backup feature has a limit that covers up to **5 users, groups, shared drives, or sites**. The Google Workspace backup feature is source-available, but **not open-source** like the rest of Duplicati. There are no limitations on restore.

A license is required to use Google Workspace backup in production. Contact Duplicati Inc. support or sales to obtain a license.
{% endhint %}

### Overview

**Key characteristics**

* **Format preservation**: Data is stored in native formats such as RFC 2822 (EML), JSON, and standard document formats. Drive documents are stored in their exported formats, such as PDF, DOCX, or XLSX.
* **Metadata retention**: Original timestamps, identifiers, and properties are preserved where possible.
* **Restore to local disk**: It is possible to restore all data to a local destination for forensics or manual investigation.
* **Cross-user support**: Data from one user can be restored into another user account.
* **Domain-wide backup**: Supports backing up all users in a Google Workspace domain via domain-wide delegation.

### Configure Google Workspace backup

To add a Google Workspace tenant to the backup, [set up a backup following the regular steps](../../getting-started/set-up-a-backup-in-the-ui.md). Then on the source page, click "Add remote path" in the top right:

Type "workspace" in the search bar, or scroll down and find "Google Workspace" in the list and click "Choose":

Fill in the information to set up the configuration. You need an Admin ID and a Service Account JSON. You can drop the JSON file in, click the browse button, or paste in the value:

Remember to test the configuration before clicking "Use remote source". You can also add the advanced options if you want to limit the content that is backed up. By default, everything is backed up:

### Google Workspace configuration options

To use the Google Workspace backup source you must supply credentials via either a service account with domain-wide delegation or OAuth 2.0 user credentials. When choosing what to back up, it is possible to filter on root types (users, groups, shared drives, sites, organizational units), and possible to apply filters to obtain fine-grained exclusion of data.

When making backups of a Google Workspace domain, the advanced option `--store-metadata-content-in-database` must be activated.

### Technical limitations

#### API limitations

| Limitation               | Description                                       | Impact                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Chat message attribution | Messages appear as sent by impersonated user      | Original sender context lost             |
| Sites export             | No comprehensive export API available             | Only metadata backed up                  |
| Google Forms             | Form responses require separate API               | Structure backed up via Drive only       |
| Revision history         | Native file revisions cannot be directly restored | Only current version restorable          |
| Calendar attachments     | Direct attachment upload not supported            | Attachments uploaded to Drive and linked |
| Keep attachments         | Direct attachment upload not supported            | Attachments uploaded to Drive and linked |

#### Permission limitations

| Feature                  | Limitation                                              | Notes                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Owner permissions        | Cannot be restored via API                              | Must be manually reassigned   |
| External sharing         | Some external sharing permissions may not be restorable | Depends on domain settings    |
| Domain-specific settings | Some settings require domain admin privileges           | May need manual configuration |

#### Data fidelity limitations

{% hint style="info" %}
For restores into Google Workspace, data is technically "created again" as the API does not support true restoration. Visually the data looks the same but internal values, such as timestamps or references, may be different in the restored version.
{% endhint %}

| Data type     | Limitation                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email         | Original Message-ID preserved, but internal Google ID changes |
| Calendar      | Online meeting links preserved but may not be recreated       |
| Contacts      | Contact ID changes on restore                                 |
| Files         | File ID changes; content hash and timestamps preserved        |
| Chat messages | Original sender/timestamp lost on restore                     |

#### Rate limiting

Google APIs have usage quotas. The implementation includes exponential backoff for:

* HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
* HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable)

| API          | Default Quota               | Recommendation            |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Gmail API    | 250 quota units/user/second | Increase for bulk backup  |
| Drive API    | 12,000 requests/minute      | Increase for large drives |
| Calendar API | 500 requests/100 seconds    | Usually sufficient        |
| People API   | 90 requests/minute          | May need increase         |

### API permissions reference

Permissions are divided by operation (backup vs restore). All permissions require admin consent for domain-wide delegation when using service accounts.

### Data format and storage

#### Backup data formats

| Data type       | Format          | Extension               |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Email content   | RFC 2822        | `.eml`                  |
| Email metadata  | JSON            | `.json`                 |
| Calendar events | JSON/ICS        | `.json`/`.ics`          |
| Contacts        | JSON/vCard      | `.json`/`.vcf`          |
| Contact photos  | Binary          | `.photo`                |
| Files           | Original/Export | (original or converted) |
| Tasks           | JSON            | `.json`                 |
| Keep notes      | JSON            | `.json`                 |
| Chat messages   | JSON            | `.json`                 |
| All metadata    | JSON            | `.json`                 |

#### Export formats for Google Workspace files

| Google Format   | Export type                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Google Docs     | DOCX                                |
| Google Sheets   | XLSX                                |
| Google Slides   | PPTX                                |
| Google Drawings | PNGß                                |
| Google Forms    | Metadata only (via Drive API)       |
| Google Sites    | Metadata only (no export available) |

#### Storage requirements

* Email: RFC 2822 content + JSON metadata per message
* Files: Original file size + metadata overhead
* Calendar: JSON per event (typically 1–10 KB)
* Contacts: JSON per contact (typically 1–5 KB)
* Tasks: JSON per task (typically 0.5–2 KB)

### Best practices

#### Backup recommendations

1. Enable metadata storage with `--store-metadata-content-in-database`.
2. Use service account authentication with domain-wide delegation for organizational backups.
3. Schedule regular backups during off-peak hours.
4. Verify required permissions before backup.
5. Monitor API quota usage and request increases if needed.

#### Restore recommendations

1. Test restore procedures regularly.
2. Verify target user exists before restore.
3. Use `--google-ignore-existing` carefully; default behavior skips duplicates.
4. Review restored sharing permissions (owner permissions cannot be restored).
5. Be aware of limitations when restoring chat messages and sites.

#### Security considerations

1. Store service account JSON and OAuth tokens securely.
2. Use least privilege principle - only request scopes that are actually needed.
3. Enable audit logging in Google Workspace Admin Console.
4. Encrypt backup data at rest.
5. Limit who can configure and run backups.
6. Rotate service account keys regularly.

### Troubleshooting

#### Common issues

| Issue                                              | Solution                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Access to calendar ACLs was denied"               | Use `--google-ignore-calendar-acl` option or grant Calendar write permission |
| "Licensed Google Workspace feature seats exceeded" | Purchase additional licenses or reduce scope of backup                       |
| "Missing credentials"                              | Verify service account JSON or OAuth credentials are correct                 |
| "Domain-wide delegation not enabled"               | Enable domain-wide delegation in Google Cloud Console and authorize scopes   |
| "Rate limit exceeded"                              | Enable exponential backoff or request quota increases                        |
