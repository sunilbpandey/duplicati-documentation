# Microsoft 365 backup and restore

Duplicati supports backing up and restoring Microsoft 365 (Office 365) data through the Microsoft Graph API. The backup workflow captures content in native formats (for example, MIME for email and JSON for structured objects), and restore operations re-create items through the appropriate Graph API endpoints.

{% hint style="info" %}
Microsoft 365 backup and restore was added in Stable 2.3
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Microsoft 365 backup feature has a limit that covers up to **5 mailboxes or sites**. The license counter excludes unlicensed shared mailboxes. The Office 365 backup feature is source-available, but **not open-source** like the rest of Duplicati. There are no limitations on restore.

A license is required to use Microsoft 365 backup in production. Contact Duplicati Inc. support or sales to obtain a license.

### Overview

**Key characteristics**

* **Format preservation**: Data is stored in native formats such as MIME, JSON, and HTML.
* **Metadata retention**: Original timestamps, identifiers, and properties are preserved where possible.
* **Restore to local disk**: It is possible to restore all data to a local destination for forensics or manual investigation.
* **Cross-tenant support**: Data can be restored into different tenants.
* **Cross-target support**: Data from one user/group/site can be restored into another.
* **Shared mailboxes**: Shared mailboxes within the tenant are detected and enumerated automatically. Unlicensed shared mailboxes do not count toward the license limit.
* **SharePoint subsites**: Subsites beneath a site collection are included in the backup.
* **Classification filtering**: Users, sites and groups can be filtered at the top level based on their classification using `--office365-included-user-classifications`, `--office365-included-site-classifications`, and `--office365-included-group-classifications`.

### Configure Microsoft 365 backup

To add a Microsoft 365 tenant to the backup, [set up a backup following the regular steps](../../getting-started/set-up-a-backup-in-the-ui.md). Then on the source page, click "Add remote path" in the top right:

Type "365" in the search bar, or scroll down and find "Microsoft 365" in the list and click "Choose":

Fill in the information to set up the configuration. You need a Tenant Id, Client Id and Client Secret for the regular setup:

Remember to test the configuration before clicking "Use remote source". You can also add the advanced options if you want to limit the content that is backed up. By default, everything is backed up:

### Microsoft 365 configuration options

To use the Microsoft 365 backup source you must supply a tenant ID and either a client secret or a certificate. When choosing what to back up, it is possible to filter on types (users, groups, etc), and possible to apply filters to obtain fine-grained exclusion of data.

When making backups of a Microsoft 365 tenant, the advanced option `--store-metadata-content-in-database` must be activated.

#### Permission limitations

| Feature         | Permission type | Notes                  |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Tasks (To-Do)   | Delegated       | Requires user context  |
| Notes (OneNote) | Delegated       | Requires user context  |
| Group calendar  | Delegated       | Requires user context  |
| All others      | Application     | Admin consent required |

#### Data fidelity limitations

{% hint style="info" %}
For restores into a Microsoft 365 tenant, data is technically "created again" as the API does not support restoring content. Visually the data looks the same but internal values, such as timestamps or references may be different in the restored version.
{% endhint %}

| Data type | Limitation                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Email     | Original message ID preserved, but internal Graph ID changes |
| Calendar  | Online meeting links preserved but not recreated             |
| Contacts  | Contact ID changes on restore                                |
| Files     | File ID changes; hash and timestamps preserved               |
| Messages  | Original sender/timestamp lost on restore                    |

### Data format and storage

#### Backup data formats

| Data type       | Format   | Extension            |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| Email content   | MIME     | `.eml`               |
| Email metadata  | JSON     | `.json`              |
| Calendar events | JSON     | `.json`              |
| Contacts        | JSON     | `.json`              |
| Contact photos  | Binary   | `.photo`             |
| Files           | Original | (original extension) |
| OneNote pages   | HTML     | `.html`              |
| All metadata    | JSON     | `.json`              |

#### Metadata structure

Each backed-up item includes metadata with common properties:

```json
{
    "o365:Type": "SourceItemType",
    "o365:Id": "Graph API ID",
    "o365:Name": "Display name",
    "o365:CreatedDateTime": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
    "o365:LastModifiedDateTime": "ISO 8601 timestamp"
}
```

#### Storage requirements

* Email: MIME content + JSON metadata per message
* Files: Original file size + metadata overhead
* Calendar: JSON per event (typically 1–10 KB)
* Contacts: JSON per contact (typically 1–5 KB)

### Cross-tenant restore

#### Supported scenarios

| Scenario                         | Supported | Notes                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Same user, same tenant           | ✅         | Default restore behavior        |
| Different user, same tenant      | ✅         | Use `--restore-path`            |
| Same user, different tenant      | ✅         | Requires credentials for target |
| Different user, different tenant | ✅         | Full cross-tenant restore       |

#### Cross-tenant considerations

1. **User mapping**: Users referenced in data (assignments, sharing) must exist in the target tenant.
2. **Group mapping**: Groups must exist in the target tenant for group-related restores.
3. **App availability**: Teams apps must be available in the target tenant’s app catalog.
4. **Permission scope**: Application must have permissions in the target tenant.

#### Restore path syntax

If not using the UI to pick the destination, the commandline syntax looks like this:

```
--restore-path="@office365://users/{target-user-id}?office365-tenant-id=..."
--restore-path="@office365://groups/{target-group-id}?office365-tenant-id=..."
--restore-path="@office365://sites/{target-site-id}?office365-tenant-id=..."
```

### Best practices

#### Backup recommendations

1. Enable metadata storage with `--store-metadata-content-in-database`.
2. Schedule regular backups.
3. Verify required permissions before backup.

#### Restore recommendations

1. Test restore procedures regularly.
2. Verify target user/group exists before restore.
3. Use `--office365-ignore-existing` carefully; default behavior skips duplicates.
4. Review restored sharing permissions.
5. Be aware of limitations when restoring into a tenant.

#### Security considerations

1. Store client secrets securely.
2. Prefer certificates over secrets in production.
3. Request only the permissions you need.
4. Monitor backup/restore operations with audit logging.
