# Connecting to the Duplicati console

The Duplicati open-source client can run without a connection to the console, but connecting the client offers additional features, such as backup monitoring, remote management, zero-configuration storage and more.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since the [Agent](../duplicati-programs/agent.md) does not have a local UI, refer to the [Agent section for information on how to register](../duplicati-programs/agent.md)
{% endhint %}

## Connect a single machine

To connect a single machine to the Duplicati console, the simplest approach is to use the dedicated "Click to register" feature shown in the top-right corner of the Duplicati open-source client screen:

After clicking "Click to register" you will need to accept adding the machine to your account:

After this, the machine is connected to the console, and no further action is needed.

## Connect with a link

{% hint style="info" %}
Links are only available with a Pro or Enterprise subscription
{% endhint %}

If you prefer a more automated way to connect to the console, you can generate a link that is pre-authenticated. This is done on the ["Links" page on the console](https://app.duplicati.com/app/machines/links):

<figure><picture><source srcset="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2026-05-28 at 11.31.47.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2026-05-28 at 11.31.37.png" alt=""></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Click "Create a new link" to create the link and set the options on the link. Then click the "Copy" button to copy the URL. On the open-source client, go to settings and paste in the link into the "Connect to console" field, replacing the existing text:

<figure><picture><source srcset="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2026-05-28 at 11.48.36.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2026-05-28 at 11.07.13.png" alt=""></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Then click "Register on console" and the open-source client will connect directly.

If you prefer to register via the commandline, you can run either [TrayIcon](../duplicati-programs/trayicon.md) or [Server](../duplicati-programs/server.md) with the `--register-remote-control=<copied-url>`, for example:

```
duplicati-server --register-remote-control=<copied-url>
```

## Connect with a file

Similar to the [link approach](connecting-to-the-duplicati-console.md#connect-with-a-link), you can also generate a file that configures the open-source client to automatically connect. This is also done on the ["Links" page on the console](https://app.duplicati.com/app/machines/links):

<figure><picture><source srcset="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2026-05-28 at 11.31.47.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2026-05-28 at 11.31.37.png" alt=""></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will then download a file named [`preload.json`](../detailed-descriptions/configuration-and-management/preload-settings.md) which has the link inside. You simply place this file in either the installation folder for Duplicati or in the [datafolder](../detailed-descriptions/database-and-storage/the-server-database.md), and the open-source client will automatically connect to the console when it (re-)starts. After starting with the preload file, the file can be deleted, but has no effect if it is left behind.
{% hint style="info" %}
Note that a `preload.json` placed inside the data folder is only loaded if the folder passes the [permission check](../detailed-descriptions/database-and-storage/the-server-database.md#limited-access-to-the-database-folder).
{% endhint %}

For automated install, an MDM tool or similar can place the `preload.json` file in the target folder prior to installing Duplicati such that it automatically connects on startup.
